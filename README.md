# weather-app

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard website what takes input of a city and loads data from the Open Weather API into the site. This application allows users to view the weather condition of any city/area around the world with on search. Throughout this project I've learnt about making fetch requests to server-side APIs, about how URL's work and how to make and utilise them. Additionally, bootstrap a CSS frame work was intergrated alone with a CSS style sheet to create a smooth and beautiful user interface. 

## Usage

Here are some photos of the site:
